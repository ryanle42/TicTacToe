# TicTacToe
Small personal project

./tictactoe in terminal to run program.

Features 4 modes:

1. Pvp
  - Take turns playing with another person.
  
2. Cpu easy
  - Makes completely random moves, simple and easy to beat.

3. Cpu medium
  - Also makes random moves but goes for the win or block if it exists.
  
4. Cpu hard
  -Super hard coded by move. Has little to no variation based on how you start.
  -Currently has one way to beat it as far as I know. ~Too lazy to patch up.
