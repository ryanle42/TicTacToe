# TicTacToe

The purpose of this project to gauge how much I've learned from a month at 42. I'm pretty happy with the result. By working on this project I could see a lot the things I need to work on - sloppy code, line count, and algorithms.

Run "make" in terminal and "./tictactoe" to run program

Features 4 modes:

1. Pvp
  - Take turns playing with another person.
  
2. Cpu easy
  - Makes completely random moves, simple and easy to beat.

3. Cpu medium
  - Also makes random moves but goes for the win or block if it exists.
  
4. Cpu hard
  - Super hard coded by move. Little to no variation in gameplay.
  - Currently has one way to beat it as far as I know.
